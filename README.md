## THIS WEEKS PROJECT - CHAT BOT
co- author: @JosefineEngdahl
The concept
A simple bot created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's collapsable and fits well into an existing website. The pep bot is on a mission to spread positivity with bright colors and cheeky messages!

## The challenge
✓ Worked in pairs (live pair programming approach)
✓ How to use variables in JavaScript.
✓ How to use conditionals in JavaScript.
✓ Know some string methods to modify strings.
✓ Understand control flow and the use of conditionals statements.
✓ How to use functions in JavaScript
✓ Different datatypes

The most challenging this week was to figure out, and get more comfortable, using predominantly JavaScript.
